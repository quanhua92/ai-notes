# Action Plan: Find Missing Learning Paths and Update README

## Purpose
Template for finding missing learning path files and ensuring all paths in the `/learning_paths/` directory are documented in README.md.

## Prerequisites
- Access to repository file system
- README.md with "Learning Paths" section

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Inventory Existing Learning Paths
```bash
# List all learning path files
# Use Glob tool: learning_paths/**/*.md
```

### 2. Extract Current README Documentation
- Read "Learning Paths" section in README.md
- Note all documented learning paths and their paths
- Pay attention to category structure if it exists

### 3. Compare and Identify Gaps
- Create list of filesystem learning paths
- Create list of README documented learning paths
- Identify missing paths: `filesystem_paths - documented_paths`

### 4. Add Missing Learning Paths to README
For each missing learning path:
- Determine appropriate category (or create new category if needed)
- Read learning path file to understand scope and target audience
- Add entry with format:
  ```markdown
  *   [Learning Path Title](./learning_paths/filename.md)
      *   *Core Concepts: Key learning areas, technologies, progression path.*
  ```

### 5. Categorization Guidelines
**Suggested Categories:**
- **Full-Stack & AI Engineering**: Comprehensive paths covering multiple tech stacks
- **Frontend Specialization**: Frontend-focused learning journeys
- **Backend Engineering**: Backend and infrastructure focused paths
- **Data Engineering**: Data science, ML, analytics focused paths
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Operations, deployment, monitoring focused paths

### 6. Verification
- Ensure all filesystem learning paths are documented
- Verify all paths are correct and files exist
- Check descriptions accurately reflect learning path content and scope
- Confirm no broken links

## Learning Path Characteristics
Learning paths should be:
- **Comprehensive**: Cover multiple related technologies/concepts
- **Progressive**: Build from fundamentals to advanced topics
- **Interconnected**: Show relationships between different areas
- **Practical**: Include hands-on projects and real-world applications

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete documentation coverage
- All learning paths discoverable via README
- Appropriate categorization for different specializations
- Clear descriptions of learning objectives and scope

## Common Issues to Watch For
- Missing learning paths not documented
- Incorrect file paths or broken links
- Unclear descriptions of learning objectives
- Poor categorization that doesn't reflect content
- Inconsistent formatting across entries
