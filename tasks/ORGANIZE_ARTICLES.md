# Action Plan: Organize In-Depth Technical Guides

## Purpose
Template for reorganizing the "In-Depth Technical Guides" section in README.md with logical subcategorization for better navigation and learning progression.

## Prerequisites
- README.md with existing "In-Depth Technical Guides" section
- All guides documented (run FIND_ARTICLES.md first if needed)

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Analyze Current Guide Categories
- Review all documented guides by technology category
- Identify categories with multiple guides that could benefit from subcategorization
- Consider logical learning progression within each category

### 2. Design Subcategory Structure
**Categories Requiring Subcategorization:**
- **AI**: Large category, group by: Fundamentals → Code Assistants → Advanced Agents
- **Rust**: Medium category, group by: Core Concepts → Production Applications
- **Other categories**: Generally keep as single sections unless they grow significantly

### 3. Create Hierarchical Structure
For large categories, implement subcategories:

```markdown
### AI

#### Fundamentals & Engineering
*   [Guide Title](./path/to/guide.md)
    *   *Core Concepts: ...*

#### AI Code Assistants  
*   [Guide Title](./path/to/guide.md)
    *   *Core Concepts: ...*

#### AI Agents & Multimodal Systems
*   [Guide Title](./path/to/guide.md)
    *   *Core Concepts: ...*
```

### 4. Order Guides Within Subcategories
**Recommended Ordering:**
- **Fundamentals first**: Core concepts, foundational knowledge
- **Specialized topics**: Specific tools, frameworks, use cases
- **Advanced applications**: Complex implementations, production systems

### 5. Maintain Content Integrity
- Preserve all existing descriptions and core concepts
- Keep all original links and paths
- Maintain consistent formatting across subcategories

## Subcategorization Guidelines

### AI Category Structure
- **Fundamentals & Engineering**: Core AI concepts, engineering practices, foundational frameworks
- **AI Code Assistants**: Specific focus on code assistant tools, integration, development workflows
- **AI Agents & Multimodal Systems**: Advanced agent frameworks, multimodal capabilities, complex systems

### Rust Category Structure
- **Fundamentals & Patterns**: Language basics, design patterns, core concepts
- **Production Applications**: Real-world implementations, full applications, deployment

### When to Add Subcategories
Consider subcategorization when:
- Category has 4+ guides
- Clear logical groupings exist
- Learning progression can be improved
- Related guides can be clustered meaningfully

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved navigation within large categories
- Clear learning progression from basics to advanced
- Better discoverability of related guides
- Maintained content while improving structure

## Quality Checks
- All original guides preserved in correct locations
- Logical subcategory groupings make sense
- Consistent formatting across all levels
- No broken links or missing content
- Clear progression from fundamentals to advanced topics
