# Action Plan: Organize Prompt Engineering Templates

## Purpose
Template for reorganizing the "Prompt Engineering Templates" section in README.md with logical categorization for better navigation and user experience.

## Prerequisites
- README.md with existing "Prompt Engineering Templates" section
- All prompts documented (run FIND_PROMPTS.md first if needed)

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Analyze Current Prompts
- Read through all documented prompts
- Understand the function and purpose of each
- Group prompts by similar functionality

### 2. Design Category Structure
**Recommended Categories:**
- **Content Creation & Learning**: Educational materials, articles, learning paths
- **Audio & Video Processing**: Transcription, enhancement, summarization
- **Engineering & Architecture**: Technical planning, system design, implementation

### 3. Reorganize Section Structure
Replace flat list with categorized structure:

```markdown
## üõ†Ô∏è Prompt Engineering Templates

### Content Creation & Learning
*   **[Prompt Name](./prompts/file.md)**: Description
...

### Audio & Video Processing  
*   **[Prompt Name](./prompts/file.md)**: Description
...

### Engineering & Architecture
*   **[Prompt Name](./prompts/file.md)**: Description
...
```

### 4. Order Within Categories
- Arrange prompts logically within each category
- Consider workflow order (e.g., generation ‚Üí enhancement ‚Üí refinement)
- Most commonly used prompts first

### 5. Maintain Consistency
- Keep all existing descriptions and links
- Use consistent formatting across categories
- Preserve all original content

## Category Guidelines

### Content Creation & Learning
For prompts that generate or enhance educational content, articles, tutorials, or learning materials.

### Audio & Video Processing
For prompts that work with transcripts, audio/video content processing, or media enhancement.

### Engineering & Architecture
For prompts that help with technical planning, system design, implementation strategies, or engineering documentation.

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved discoverability by functional grouping
- Better user experience and navigation
- Scalable organization for future prompts
- Maintained content while improving structure

## Quality Checks
- All original prompts preserved
- Consistent formatting across categories
- Logical grouping makes sense
- No broken links or paths
