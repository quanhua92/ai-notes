# The AI Engineer
*Build production-ready AI systems from LLMs to multimodal agents*

**Duration**: 6-8 weeks | **Level**: Intermediate to Advanced | **Prerequisites**: Python basics + one systems path recommended

---

## Your Journey Overview

Master the rapidly evolving field of AI Engineering by building production-grade intelligent systems. This isn't about training models from scratch—it's about **orchestrating existing models** to solve real-world problems at scale.

### What You'll Build
- **RAG Systems**: Knowledge-grounded AI that answers questions about your data
- **AI Agents**: Autonomous systems that can reason, plan, and execute actions
- **Multimodal Applications**: AI that understands text, images, audio, and video
- **Production Pipelines**: Scalable AI systems with proper monitoring and reliability

---

## Learning Philosophy: The AI Engineering Mindset

AI Engineering is fundamentally different from traditional ML. Instead of training models, you're **composing intelligence** from powerful pre-trained models. Think of yourself as a conductor orchestrating an AI symphony.

### Core Mental Models

**🧠 LLMs as Reasoning Engines**  
Large Language Models aren't just text generators—they're **reasoning engines** that can analyze, plan, and make decisions. Your job is to give them the right context and tools.

**🔍 RAG as Memory Augmentation**  
Retrieval-Augmented Generation transforms "closed-book" AI into "open-book" AI by providing relevant context. It's like giving the AI access to a searchable library.

**🤖 Agents as Autonomous Systems**  
An AI Agent combines reasoning (LLM) with action (tools). It's the difference between a chatbot that answers questions and a system that gets things done.

vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=chunked_docs,
    embedding=embeddings
)

# 2. Create retrieval-augmented chain
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0),
    chain_type="stuff",

        # Scaled dot-product attention
        attention = self.scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask)
        
        # Concatenate heads and put through final linear layer
        concat = attention.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, self.d_model)

    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
    with torch.no_grad():
