# The System Design Expert
*Master distributed patterns across multiple languages*

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Level**: Advanced | **Prerequisites**: 2+ years development experience

---

## Your Journey Overview

Elevate from individual contributor to technical leader by mastering the art and science of **distributed systems design**. This path teaches you to think at the architecture level, making technology choices that scale from thousands to millions of users.

### What You'll Build
- **Language-Agnostic Patterns**: Core distributed systems concepts that apply everywhere
- **Multi-Language Implementations**: Same patterns in Go, Rust, and TypeScript
- **Architecture Decision Records**: Documented reasoning for technical choices
- **Scalability Case Studies**: Real-world examples from startup to enterprise scale

---

## Learning Philosophy: The Architect's Perspective

System design is about **making informed trade-offs**. Every architectural decision involves balancing competing forces: consistency vs. availability, performance vs. maintainability, simplicity vs. flexibility. You'll learn to think like a chess master, seeing several moves ahead.

### Core Mental Models

**üèóÔ∏è Conway's Law in Practice**  
Your system architecture will mirror your organization's communication structure. Design your teams and communication patterns alongside your technical architecture.

**üìê The CAP Theorem Reality**  
In a distributed system, you can only guarantee two of: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. Most real systems choose AP (available and partition-tolerant) and implement eventual consistency patterns.

**üéØ Start Simple, Scale Smart**  
Begin with the simplest architecture that could possibly work, then evolve based on actual bottlenecks, not imagined ones. Premature optimization is the root of all evil, but premature complexity is even worse.

## Phase 1: Distributed Systems Fundamentals (Week 1)
*Master the core patterns that power all scalable systems*

### üéØ **Learning Goals**
- [ ] Understand distributed systems trade-offs and failure modes
- [ ] Master task execution and workflow orchestration patterns
- [ ] Design for fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- [ ] Learn when to choose different consistency models

### üìö **Study Guide**
**Primary**: [Distributed Task Execution & Workflow Patterns](../technical_guides/system_design/distributed-task-execution-workflow-patterns.md)

### üõ†Ô∏è **Hands-On Project**: Workflow Orchestration Engine
Design a system that can coordinate complex, multi-step business processes:
```yaml
# Your goal: understand orchestration vs choreography
# Workflow Definition (YAML DSL)
name: order-fulfillment
version: 1.0

workflow:
  - name: validate-order
    type: sync-task
    service: order-service
    endpoint: /validate
    timeout: 5s
    retry_policy:
      max_attempts: 3
      backoff: exponential
    
  - name: reserve-inventory
    type: async-task
    depends_on: [validate-order]
    service: inventory-service
    topic: inventory.reserve
    timeout: 30s
    compensation: inventory.release
    
  - name: process-payment
    type: sync-task
    depends_on: [validate-order]
    service: payment-service
    endpoint: /charge
    timeout: 10s
    
  - name: ship-order
    type: async-task
    depends_on: [reserve-inventory, process-payment]
    service: shipping-service
    topic: shipping.create
    
  - name: send-confirmation
    type: fire-and-forget
    depends_on: [ship-order]
    service: notification-service
    topic: notification.email

# Error handling and compensation
compensation_flows:
  reserve-inventory:
    - service: inventory-service
      topic: inventory.release
  process-payment:
    - service: payment-service
      endpoint: /refund
```

### ‚úÖ **Checkpoint Questions**
1. What are the trade-offs between orchestration and choreography patterns?
2. How do you handle partial failures in distributed workflows?
3. When should you use synchronous vs. asynchronous communication?

---

## Phase 2: Multi-Language Implementation (Week 1-2)
*See how the same patterns manifest across different ecosystems*

### üéØ **Learning Goals**
- [ ] Implement identical systems in Go, Rust, and TypeScript
- [ ] Understand ecosystem-specific trade-offs and idioms
- [ ] Compare performance, maintainability, and developer experience
- [ ] Learn when to choose each language for different components

### üìö **Study Guides**
**Multi-Language Deep Dive**:
- [Go Implementation](../technical_guides/system_design/distributed-task-execution-workflow-patterns-go.md)
- [Rust Implementation](../technical_guides/system_design/distributed-task-execution-workflow-patterns-rust.md)  
- [TypeScript Implementation](../technical_guides/system_design/distributed-task-execution-workflow-patterns-typescript.md)

# ADR-001: Message Queue vs Event Store for Order Processing

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to build an order processing system that handles 10,000+ orders per day with the following requirements:
- Guaranteed message delivery (no lost orders)
- Audit trail for compliance (SOX requirements)
- Support for complex order workflows with multiple steps
- Integration with 5+ downstream services
- Ability to replay events for debugging and recovery

We are evaluating three approaches:
1. Traditional message queue (RabbitMQ/AWS SQS)
2. Event streaming platform (Apache Kafka)
3. Event sourcing with event store (EventStore DB)

## Decision
We will use **Apache Kafka as our primary messaging backbone** with event sourcing patterns for order aggregates.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Durability**: Kafka's log-based storage provides excellent durability guarantees
- **Replay Capability**: Can replay any time range of events for debugging or reprocessing
- **Scalability**: Can handle our projected 100k+ orders/day growth
- **Integration**: Well-supported connectors for all our downstream services
- **Audit Trail**: Event log provides complete audit trail out of the box

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More complex than traditional queues, requires Kafka expertise
- **Operational Overhead**: Need to manage Kafka cluster, monitoring, etc.
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs training on event sourcing patterns
- **Storage Cost**: Retaining full event history is more expensive than simple queues

### Neutral
- **Eventual Consistency**: Acceptable for our use case, orders don't need real-time consistency
- **Schema Evolution**: Kafka supports schema evolution, but requires discipline

## Implementation Plan
1. Week 1-2: Set up Kafka cluster with basic monitoring
2. Week 3-4: Implement order event sourcing with basic replay functionality
3. Week 5-6: Build consumer services for inventory, payment, shipping
4. Week 7-8: Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
5. Week 9-10: Load testing and performance optimization

## Alternatives Considered

### RabbitMQ/SQS (Traditional Queue)
**Pros**: Simple, well-understood, good tooling, mature ecosystem
**Cons**: Limited replay capability, harder to build audit trails, scaling limitations
**Why Rejected**: Doesn't meet audit/replay requirements

### EventStore DB (Purpose-built Event Store)
**Pros**: Purpose-built for event sourcing, excellent projection capabilities
**Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less operational experience in team, limited integration options
**Why Rejected**: Team familiarity and integration ecosystem concerns

## Monitoring and Success Metrics
- Message throughput: Target 1000+ messages/second
- End-to-end latency: 95th percentile < 5 seconds
- Consumer lag: < 10 seconds during normal operations
- Availability: 99.9% uptime (8.7 hours downtime/year)

## Review Date
6 months from implementation (2024-08-01)
```

### ‚úÖ **Checkpoint Questions**
1. How do you balance technical debt against feature velocity in architectural decisions?
2. What factors should influence the choice between different consistency models?
3. How do you document and communicate architectural decisions to stakeholders?
