**CONTENT PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):**
- Do NOT change, add, remove, or alter any actual words or phrases from the original text

- Maintain all original ideas, examples, and explanations exactly as written

**STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS:**
- Add clear headings (##) and subheadings (**bold**) to organize content logically
- Create proper paragraph breaks to split long sections into digestible chunks

**PUNCTUATION AND GRAMMAR:**
- Add proper punctuation (periods, commas, question marks, exclamation marks)
- Correct capitalization for sentence starts and proper nouns
- Fix run-on sentences by adding appropriate breaks
- Ensure proper sentence structure while keeping original wording

**VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS:**
- Add strategic emoji (maximum 1-2 per major section) for visual appeal
- Use **bold text** for key terms and emphasis
- Create blockquotes (>) for important quotes or key statements
- Use bullet points (-) only when listing items that are clearly enumerated in original text
- Add code blocks (```) for technical examples or data sequences
- Create tables when comparing multiple items or showing structured data

**FORMATTING ELEMENTS:**
- Use markdown formatting throughout
- Add visual separators between major sections
- Highlight key concepts without changing the original words
- Create a clear hierarchy of information
- Ensure consistent formatting style throughout

**FINAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- The result should be significantly more readable and visually appealing
- All original content must remain completely intact
- Focus on clarity and accessibility while maintaining authenticity
- Add a brief note at the end acknowledging the formatting improvements made

**EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:**
```
