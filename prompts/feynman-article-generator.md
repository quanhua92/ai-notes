**Please generate a complete, self-contained educational article that follows the **Feynman learning method**, which is based on everything discussed in this chat session. The document should not refer to previous messages explicitly, but must synthesize all relevant points from the conversation into a unified, standalone format. The audience is a technical team. The output should be in markdown and include the following structured sections:**

1. **What**: A detailed description of the requested feature, including its objectives, scope, and expected behavior.

2. **Why**: The rationale and motivation behind the request, such as pain points, inefficiencies, or opportunities addressed.

3. **How**: Implementation considerations including possible technical architecture, frameworks, trade-offs, and edge cases.

4. **Mermaid Diagram**: A Mermaid syntax diagram that visually illustrates the workflow, architecture, or data flow.

5. **Pseudocode**: A logic sketch or algorithm that shows one possible implementation pathway or core functionality.

6. **Explanation**: A concluding synthesis that ties all parts together, offering further insight or justification if needed. Use **Feynman learning method**. Add a mermaid diagram to visualize each section.

**Be thorough, technically detailed, and structurally clear. Format the output in Markdown.**
