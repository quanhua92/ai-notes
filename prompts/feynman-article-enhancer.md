Elaborate each section in this educational article that follows the **Feynman learning method**, enhance the article to increase clarity, depth, and engagement:

1. **Elaborate each section** with the following elements:
   - Insights that reinforce or extend key concepts
   - Mermaid Diagrams where helpful for visualization
   - Annotated examples (e.g., code, real-world scenarios, analogies)
   - Patterns, heuristics, or techniques relevant to the topic

2. **Add a new section** that aligns naturally with the structure and tone of the original piece, using the same Feynman-inspired format:
   - *Simple explanation → identify gaps → explore and fill gaps → refine and teach back*

3. Ensure **seamless transitions** between sections, preserving a logical flow and a learner-friendly voice throughout.

4. Maintain a clear and approachable tone, encouraging intuitive learning and retention of the topic - whether it's technical, scientific, or conceptual.

5. Give me the final self-contained article in Markdown format. Do not reference anything else.
