# Prompt Engineering Templates

Welcome to a collection of powerful, protocol-based prompts designed to transform how you work with AI. Each prompt uses a **MANDATORY PROCESSING PROTOCOL** that forces AI systems to think systematically and deliver consistent, professional results.

## How These Prompts Work

Every prompt follows a proven 4-stage approach that acts as a "forcing function":

1. **DATA INGESTION** - AI analyzes your input thoroughly (internal process)
2. **EXECUTION PLANNING** - AI creates a systematic plan (internal process) 
3. **SYNTHESIS & GENERATION** - AI executes with strict quality rules
4. **FINALIZATION** - AI performs quality checks and delivers polished output

This architecture ensures AI follows your expected approach while adapting to different contexts and input types.
